          <div class="step-list">
            <div class="step-point"><p>In 2018, the world discovered one of the biggest data privacy scandals in history. A company called Cambridge Analytica secretly harvested the personal information of over 87 million Facebook users — without their consent.</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><p>It all started with something harmless-looking: a fun quiz like “Which Disney character are you?” People took the test and agreed to share their Facebook data, not realizing the app was also collecting information from their friends’ profiles.</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><p>Cambridge Analytica then used this massive pool of data to build psychological profiles of users — their fears, interests, and beliefs — and then targeted them with personalized political ads. In other words, their own data was used to subtly shape their opinions and even influence how they voted.</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><p>The revelation shocked the world. Suddenly, people realized that what seemed like a free and fun social network was actually powered by something much more serious — the trade of personal data.</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><p>The scandal raised crucial questions:</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><li>Are we truly free online, or are we being silently manipulated?</li></div>
            <div class="step-point"><li>How much control do we actually have over our digital identities?</li></div>
            <div class="step-point"><li>And who should be held responsible when our private information becomes a political tool?</li></div>

          <div class="step-list">
            <div class="step-point"><p>In 2022, an anonymous hacker known as “ChinaDan” claimed to have stolen a massive database from the Shanghai National Police, containing the personal information of around one billion Chinese citizens — making it potentially one of the largest data breaches in history.</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><p>The hacker posted on a dark web forum, offering to sell over 23 terabytes of data for 10 bitcoins (around $200,000). The leaked data allegedly included names, addresses, national ID numbers, phone numbers, birthplaces, and even detailed police records.</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><p>While Reuters couldn’t verify the authenticity of the leak, the claim spread quickly across Chinese social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat — before discussions were censored and the hashtag “data leak” was blocked.</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><p>Experts said that if the information truly came from China’s Ministry of Public Security, it would represent one of the worst data breaches ever recorded. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng suggested the leak might have resulted from a security flaw in an Elasticsearch database used by a government agency.</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><p>The incident came just as China had been tightening laws to protect online privacy and ordering tech companies to handle user data more responsibly. Ironically, the alleged breach suggested that even state institutions — not just private tech firms — can fail to protect citizens’ most sensitive information.</p></div>

            <div class="step-point"><strong>Place a Fraud Alert</strong><p>Contact one of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion). They are legally required to tell the other two. A fraud alert makes it harder for someone to open new credit in your name, as lenders must verify your identity first. It's free and lasts for one year</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><strong>Consider a Credit Freeze</strong><p>This is more severe and effective than a fraud alert. A credit freeze locks your credit file entirely, preventing anyone (including you) from opening new accounts until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. It's free and highly recommended if your SSN was exposed</p></div>
            <div class="step-point"><strong>Monitor Your Accounts and Credit Reports</strong><p>Scrutinize bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions. Get your free annual credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com to check for new accounts you didn't open</p></div>
